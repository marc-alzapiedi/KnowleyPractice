# Is Special Number

Create the isSpecialNumber function that accepts the positive number â€” n, and determines if it is special.

A number is special if each of its digits is not greater than 5 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5).

The function should return the 'Special!!' string if the number is special, and 'NOT!!' otherwise.
