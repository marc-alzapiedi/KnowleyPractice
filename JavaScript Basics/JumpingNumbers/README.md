# Juming Numbers

Implement the isJumping function, that accepts the number and returns the 'JUMPING' string if each digit in the number differs from its neighbor by 1 or 'NOT JUMPING' otherwise.

Please note:

the input number is always positive;
the difference between 9 and 0 is not 1;
if there are identical digits nearby, the number is 'NOT JUMPING';
if the number has only one digit â€” it is 'JUMPING'.
