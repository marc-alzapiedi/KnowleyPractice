# Get Robot Schema

We want to know what data our robots need to function correctly, but we can't seem to find the documentation. Let's extract all the fields from one of the robots that's currently online.

Create the function getRobotSchema that:

Takes a robot object
Returns the robot schema â€” an object with the same keys, but data types as values.
