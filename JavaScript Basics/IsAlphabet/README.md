# Is Alphabet

The first graders will have an exam tomorrow. They will be checked for an alphabet knowledge. Imagine how much work the teacher should do.

Children have the task to recall the order of the letters in the alphabet and write down as many letters as they can. Doesn't matter whether the letters are capital or lowercased. The teacher's job is to check whether children write the letters in the correct order and whether the letter is missing in the line.

Let's help the teacher with the isAlphabet function that will take letters and return true if the order of the letters matches the order in the alphabet, otherwise false.
