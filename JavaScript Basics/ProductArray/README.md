# Product Array

Create the function getArrayProduct that processes an array of numbers and returns a new array of the same length. Each element in the new array should be the product of all the original array's elements â€” except the one at the current position.

Here are the key points to remember:

The input array will always have at least two elements
All numbers in the input array are positive
Numbers in the array may appear more than once
