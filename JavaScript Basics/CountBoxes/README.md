# Count Boxes

We need to perform an inventory check in our warehouse, and part of that involves teaching the robots to recognize and count different types of boxes. A single box is represented by a single letter, and all boxes are aggregated in one string — like aaabcdaaabcd.

Create the function countBoxes that:

Takes a string of boxes — boxes.
Returns an object indicating the quantity of each box type.
