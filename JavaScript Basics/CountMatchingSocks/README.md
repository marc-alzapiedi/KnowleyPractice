# Count Matching Socks

Create the function countMatchingSocks that calculates the maximum number of sock pairs you can find based on their colors. Each sock's color is represented by a number in an array called colors.

Hereâ€™s what to consider:

The function takes an array colors, with each element representing the color of a sock.
It returns the total number of matching pairs (a pair = two socks of the same color).
For each color, you can only form a pair if there are at least two socks of that color.
