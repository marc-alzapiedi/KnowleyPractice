# Count Letters in String

Create the function countLettersInString that analyzes a given lowercase string and returns an object. This object should map each letter to the number of times it appears in the string.

Here's how to do it:

Initialize an empty object to hold the letter counts.
Loop through each character in the string.
For each character, increase its count in the object. If the character doesn't exist in the object yet, add it with a count of 1.
After processing all characters, return the object with the letter counts.
The function should handle strings without uppercase letters, as specified.
