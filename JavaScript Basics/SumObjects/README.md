# Sum objects

Create the function sumObjects that accepts any number of objects and returns a single object that merges all the input objects. Keep in mind:

The properties of the objects will only contain numeric values.
If two or more objects have the same key, the resulting object will have those values added together.
The function will always return an object, even if it's empty.
The values in the objects can include both positive and negative numbers.
Utilize the rest operator to gather all function arguments into a single array.
