# Find Calculation Type

You have to create a function findCalculationType, which receives 3 arguments: 2 numbers, and the result of an unknown operation performed on them (also a number).

Based on those 3 values you have to return a string, that describes which operation was used to get the given result.

The possible return strings are: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

Notes:

In case of division you should expect that the result of the operation is obtained by using / operator on the input values - no manual data type conversion or rounding should be performed.
Only valid arguments will be passed to the function.
The values that come in the parameters provide only one possible operation to achieve the result.
