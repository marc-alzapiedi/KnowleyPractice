# Scrolling Text

And now you will learn how to change the order of characters in a string.

Write the scrollingText function that:

accepts the word string;
sequentially rearranges all characters in the string from zero index to the last one;
returns an array with the given string and all the received combinations in the uppercase.
For example, for the 'robot' we have:

take the first character r and put it to the end of the word — 'obotr';
take the current first character of the 'obotr' (o) and put it to the end — 'botro' and so on.
