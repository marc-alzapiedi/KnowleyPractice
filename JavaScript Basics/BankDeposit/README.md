# Bank deposit

In Mate Bank, you have the chance to deposit money and earn interest over time. For instance, depositing $10,000 for 3 years at a 4% annual interest rate yields:

First year: $10,000 + 4% = $10,400 (calculated as $10,000 + $10,000 * 0.04)
Second year: $10,400 + 4% = $10,816 (calculated as $10,400 + $10,400 * 0.04)
Third year: $10,816 + 4% = $11,248.64 (calculated as $10,816 + $10,816 * 0.04)
Net profit: $11,248.64 - $10,000 = $1,248.64
Your task: Implement the calculateProfit function that takes 3 parameters:

amount — the initial deposit amount
percent — annual interest rate (in percentage)
period — the number of years the money is deposited
