# Array Leaders

The getLeaders function analyzes an array of numbers and identifies "Leaders" in the array. A "Leader" is defined as an element that is greater than the sum of all elements to its right.

Here's what to keep in mind:

The input array always has at least three elements.
The array can contain both positive and negative numbers, and numbers may repeat.
The function returns an array of Leaders, maintaining their original order.
If there are no elements to the right of a number, consider the sum to its right as 0.
