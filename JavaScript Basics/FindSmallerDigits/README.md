# Find Smaller Digits

Create the function countNextSmaller that:

Takes an array of numbers as input.
Returns a new array where each element represents how many numbers to the right of the current number are smaller than it.
For instance, given the array [1, 2, 0]:

For 1, there's one element to the right (0) that is smaller, so we get 1.
For 2, there's also one smaller element to the right (0), resulting in 1.
For 0, there are no elements to the right, so we get 0.
Therefore, the result for this array is [1, 1, 0].
