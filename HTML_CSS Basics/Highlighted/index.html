    <h1>
      Franz Kafka
    </h1>

    <p>
      One morning, <span class="description highlighted">when Gregor 
      Samsa woke from troubled dreams</span>, 
      he found himself transformed in his bed into a 
      <span class="description highlighted">horrible vermin</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head 
      a little he could see his <span class="important highlighted">brown belly, slightly domed and 
      divided by arches into stiff sections</span>. The bedding was hardly 
      able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.
    </p>

    <p>
      His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the 
      rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. <span class="question highlighted">"What's 
      happened to me?"</span> he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a 
      proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully 
      between its four familiar walls.
    </p>

    <p>
      A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the 
      table - <span class="description highlighted">Samsa was a travelling salesman</span> 
      - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated 
      magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted 
      out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, <span class="description highlighted">raising a heavy fur muff 
      that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer</span>. Gregor then 
      turned to look out the window at the dull weather.
