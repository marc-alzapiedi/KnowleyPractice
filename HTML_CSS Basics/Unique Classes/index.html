    <h2 class="subtitle">Iago speaks to Roderigo</h2>

    <p class="poem">
      O, sir, content you;
      I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
      We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
      Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
      Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
      That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
      Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
      For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:
      Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
      Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
      Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
      And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
      Do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats
      Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
      And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
      It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
      Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
      In following him, I follow but myself;
      Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
      But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
      For when my outward action doth demonstrate
      The native act and figure of my heart
      In compliment extern, 'tis not long after
      But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
      For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.
    </p>
