      Li Europan lingues
    </h1>
    <p>
      The European languages are members of the same family.
      Their separate existence is a myth.<strong> For science, music, 
      sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary.</strong> The languages 
      only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their 
      most common words. <span>Everyone realizes why a new common 
      language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay 
      expensive translators.</span> To achieve this, it would be 
      necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and 
      more common words.
    </p>
      <p class="second">      
        If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting 
        language is more simple and regular than that of the individual 
        languages. <strong>The new common language will be more simple and regular 
        than the existing European languages.</strong> It will be as simple as 
        Occidental; <span>in fact, it will be Occidental.</span> To an English person, 
        it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge 
        friend of mine told me what Occidental is. The European languages 
        are members of the same family. <strong>Their separate existence is a myth.</strong> 
        For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. 
        <em>The languages only differ in their grammar</em>, their pronunciation and 
        their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language 
        would be desirable: <span>one could refuse to pay expensive translators.</span>
