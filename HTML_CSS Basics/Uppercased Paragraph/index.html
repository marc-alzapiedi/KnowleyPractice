    <h1>
      Stocks Collapse in 16,410,030-Share Day,
      but Rally at Close Cheers Brokers;
      Bankers Optimistic, to Continue Aid
    </h1>
    <h2>
      By THE NEW YORK TIMES
    </h2>

    <p>
      Stock prices virtually collapsed yesterday, swept downward with gigantic
      losses in the most disastrous trading day in the stock market's history.
      Billions of dollars in open market values were wiped out as prices crumbled
      under the pressure of liquidation of securities which had to be sold at any
      price.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was an impressive rally just at the close, which brought many leading
      stocks back from 4 to 14 points from their lowest points of the day.
    </p>

    <p class="aggregated">
      Trading on the New York Stock Exchange <strong>aggregated 16,410,030 shares</strong>;
      on the Curb, <strong>7,096,300 shares were dealt in</strong>. <em>Both totals far exceeded any
        previous day's dealings.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      From every point of view, in the extent of losses sustained, in total
      turnover, in the number of speculators wiped out, the day was the most
      disastrous in Wall Street's history. Hysteria swept the country and
      stocks went overboard for just what they would bring at forced sale.
